# Music-Player
This project is a simple, yet stylish music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features play, pause, next, and previous functionalities. A music progress bar is also included to track the song's progress. The design is elegant and features a blurred album cover in the background for an aesthetic look.
